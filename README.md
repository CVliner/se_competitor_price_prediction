### Introduction

### SE - Competitor Price Forecast

Competitor price prediction with Python enables businesses to forecast future sales based on factors like business expenses, customer segmentation and price positioning of item. Using ML-techniques, companies can analyze historical data, construct predictive models and make decisions to optimize marketing strategies, allocate resources efficiently and maximize sales. By timely updating the models with new data, commpany can adapt to market dynamics and achieve better performance in a competitive environment.

### Usage

git clone https://github.com/CVliner/se_competitor_price_prediction.git

cd se_competitor_price_prediction

Place the Data/price_competitor.csv dataset in the project directory.

Run the script:
python competitor_price_prediction.py


### Dataset
Datas in Dataset have been collected according to main competitor prices based on commercial offers for customers during 2004-2020.
### Results
Overall, VFD inverter prices have shown an upward trend over the years. This reflects general market inflation, increased demand, and potential improvements in technology and features. Danfoss inverters are the most expensive, while Mitsubishi inverters are the cheapest. VACON VFDs have stable prices during whole period with steady increases. Siemens and ABB show similar price trends and periodic similarities in their pricing.

### Recommendations
For further observation and price prediction, it is recommended to:

1) Make market segmentation of inverters and analyze the volume of VFD sales.
2) Update the model and improve prediction models.
3) Continue data analysis.
4) Create a marketing strategy.
